# weatherAPP
This code creates a simple **Weather App** where the user can enter a city name, and on clicking the button, it fetches real-time weather data (temperature, wind speed, and icon) from the WeatherAPI. It then dynamically displays the location details, temperature, weather icon, and wind speed on the webpage.
